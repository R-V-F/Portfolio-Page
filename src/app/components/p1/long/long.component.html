<h1>Overview</h1>
<p><span class="grey">dot</span>Canvas is an <a href="">r/place</a> inspired app. The idea is to provide users
    with a canvas, where they can zoom in and place pixels on it. Anyone connected will be able to
    see the pixels being placed live, which gives the site a 'lively' feel (when populated).</p>
